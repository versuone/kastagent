**1/ [What is KastAgent ?](#top)**  

**K**astAgent is the agent for KastMenu.  
KastAgent is automanaged and deployed by KastMenu.  
So this project is not intend to be downloaded/installed standalone outside KastMenu.  
But is there to follow the development of KastAgent.  
Hence KastAgent is periodically integrated into KastMenu under the directory kastagent.  

  
**K**astAgent is the remote counterpart of the KastMenu server and runs on the target machine.  
For the KastMenu Server, see the KastMenu project.  

  
**K**astAgent is both a Web and a Terminal Menu.

* It is trigered remotly by KastMenu server or locally by the user, via SSH  and runs on a local machine or VM.
* It is called for a specific User and runs under the User of this session.  
* It runs everywhere you can have a unix Terminal.  
* It provides Web or Terminal Menu access to any unix comands under the unix security paradygm.  

**K**astAgent aims to support any linux distributions,  
while KastMenu server will only plan to support real free linux: debian distributions and derivatives.  

  
**K**astAgent is Powefull because it can run any command that runs on Unix.  
  
**K**astAgent Learning Curve is 0 because you set the command as expected in normal terminal into a menu file.  
This menu file supports 3 formats:  

* XML or
* YAML or
* HCL
You choose the one which suits you.  
  
**K**astAgent is WYSIWYG:  
The supported tags are Logical and StraightForward:  
Config
* **Menu**
* **IMenu**
Menu tags also support Other Menu or IMenu tags.  
IMenu tags also support Other IMenu or Menu tags.  
Option has an Attribute "command" to call a shell command.  
IMenu has an Attribute "command" to call a shell command on validation of the IMenu.  
  
**The command output is not perverted nor tansformed** it is directly dumped, the User sees what he gets from the command output.  
  
**K**astAgent is interactive:  
IMenu are **interactive** Menus, they supports **input fields** as IOptions:  
IOptions are **input fields** with their type leverage by **[wk](./wk.html)** a simple an intuitive declarative type libray.  
<br>
  
**2/ [How it runs ?](#top)**  
  
**K**astAgent runs simply as:  
$ **km** myfile.xml  
*(or **km** myfile.yaml, km myfile.hcl or longer **kastmenu** myfile.xml)*  
  
An Attribute "command" can explicitly call another km process with the option: --follow-menu:  
e.g.:  
<Option command="**km** --follow-menu myfile.xml" ...>  
  
**M**enus are **infinitly** imbricable (It is a tree) because:  

* **Menu**, **IMenu** are reciprocally imbricables.
* **km** process can call another km process indefinitly through the tag's **command** Attribute.
  
The syntax of the kastmenu (km) command is [here](./cde-km.html).  
The syntax of the convert command is [here](./cde-convert.html)  
<br>
  
**3/ [What Public is it dedicated for ?](#top)**  
  
**KastAgent is a fair Interactive View of your System**  
  
Because it is structured it allows you to publish only what you want the User to see/access on your system.  
  
It is also **didactic**, whith the nowaday **Developers/Devops pressure** who want to have more and more access to the system's commands.  
This is **not an open ssh** and the Devs can be **happy to see their commands** and openly watch their **not perverted** output.  
  
For these reasons KastAgent is suit to:  

* **New incomming Chalenger Cloud providers:**  
  who directly want to compete big ones providing the treasure of nowadays mass of cloud management commands.  

  * In a per User basis and didactic and structural way.
  * It fast and easy to implement in large scales.
* **Developers/Devops:**  
  Because they want more and more direct accesses to the commands provided by the hyper prolific world  
  of the cloud frameworks of any kinds, public or private.  
  They know them and are actually capable of providing a subset xml of commands to the Admins in order to manages their Applications.
* **Cloud Engineers:**  
  Who want to provide access to complex but monitored commands of the backends to their peers or users.
* **Admins:**  
  Who want to provide powerfull but limited access to the backends.  
  Or to provide: install, start, stop, recovering ... commands, to other departments, e.g. to the supervisors.
* **DBAs:**  
  Who want to access to the strength of their Databases system commands.  
  Or want to publish accesses to their batch commands, to non DBAs expert like night Admins.
* **Supervisors:**  
  Who have to run heartbeat commands on Applications,  
  or to run dedicated recovering command on them.
* **To welcome a Newbee in any of this department:**  
  A restrictive but self demonstrating access to a part of your infrastructure.  
  This way the newbee also learn the commands.
* **To Students:**  
  Students directly see the real commands not perverted by any transformation, running into their real environment.  
  And they can tune them.
* **To Training plaform:** Demo, train and test your students on real platforms.

**4/ [KastAgent Log System](#top)**  
  
Abusivly called BigBrother.  
  
Shows in **Realtime**, in colors and **Visually identical**, the very Menu, the User is running into his private terminal:  
Each options, each commands, each output the User runs in real time, is seen.  
This is accessable by a **simple tail -f or cat on the log file** to anyone who has the right to access to it.  
  
This is simply powerfull, use it with care.  
The usefulness of this is obvious.  
  
Called with option -L will enable the log system:  
$ **km** -L -l <logdir> myfile.xml  
<br>
  
**5/ [KastAgent Replay](#top)**  
  
**All Menu actions are replayable.**  
  
When the option -L is choosen: km will log and will write a **menupath** for each action taken by the User, into the log file:  
e.g. menupath: 1..1.3.2.0.0.4  
When called with a menupath: e.g.:  
km -g 1..1.3.2.0.0.4 -p 5s  
  
KastAgent will **replay** the Menu exactly how it was previously run and **pause** 5 seconds **on every screen**.  
  
Note: Beware if the original file (myfile.xml) changes, the menupath may change.  
<br>
  
**6/ [KastAgent Help Sytem](#top)**  
  
Each KastAgent tag supports an Attribute: "help".  
This allows to provide an help at the top level menu and to Each (I)Menu and (I)Option.  
  
This help system is multi-language and based on dbm lang dictionaries tuned by the User.  
Help attributes can either be text literal or link to a key of this dictionary.  
<br>
  
**7/ [KastAgent runs under the User and this is Powerfull !](#top)**  
  
In the unix world, Software set the User's credentials and specifics as hidden files under the home directory:  
For example if I list mine:  
  
patrick@server1$ pwd  
*/home/patick*  
patrick@server1$ ls -a | grep "^\\."  
*.docker  
.kube  
.profile  
.ssh  
.subversion  
...*  
So running under the unix User is running under all his credentials and authorizations to access these softwares.  
<br>

**8/ [KastAgent Install](#top)**  
  
**K**astAgent is automatically installed by KastMenu the first time the user tries to access to a new machine/VM.__

Run:   
**/opt/kastmenu/current/bin/km  /opt/kastmenu/current/conf/welcome/tutorials.xml**  

Now you can start by cloning editing tutorials.xml with your own shell commands,  
or create your own menu files.  

kastmenu_1.0 was tested under:  
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
